            <span>DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE CHECKING THE BOX ON THE BOTTOM</span><br>
            <br>
            <span>Pre-Existing Conditions/Waiver</span><br>
            You agree that Paw Paw is not responsible for any known or unknown pre-existing or degenerative medical
            conditions (or the aggravation of such condition) such as heart disease, arthritis, intervertebral disc
            disease (IVDD), cruciate ligament tears, brachycephalic syndrome infections, or any other medical problem
            that may be affected by the grooming process. You understand that shaving / de-matting a matted pet may
            reveal pre-existing skin conditions that were unable to be identified prior to shaving or de-matting and
            that Paw Paw is not responsible for issues that are revealed by or arise due to shaving/ de-matting a matted
            pet including skin irritations, poor hair re-growth, coat color changes, nicks to moles or skin growths,
            aural hematomas, and odd behaviors. In the event mats are found, if pet could be de-matted, your stylist
            will de-mat the pet with additional charge; if mats are not able to be de-matted, you authorize our stylist
            to shave the matted area(s).<br>
            <br>
            <span>Veterinary Treatment</span><br>
            In the unlikely event your pet becomes ill, injured, or requires medical attention, Paw Paw will attempt to
            notify you or your emergency contact as quickly as possible at the phone number(s) you provided. If we
            cannot reach you or your emergency contact, or in the case of an emergency, you authorize Paw Paw to serve
            as your Agent and agree that Paw Paw may seek veterinary care and make health care decisions at your
            expense. You hereby knowingly and with informed consent,
            authorize the release of all veterinary records to Paw Paw for any medical treatment received by your pet in
            possible connection with service.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Vaccinations</span><br>
            Paw Paw requires proof that your pet’s Rabies vaccine is current and any other vaccines required by the
            city. Also, Paw Paw strongly recommends that your pet be vaccinated against certain infectious conditions,
            including DHPP, Leptospirosis Bordetella, and Canine Influenza. It is still possible for vaccinated pets to
            become ill with an infectious condition despite being vaccinated. You agree that you will not hold Paw Paw
            liable in the event your pet becomes ill with an infectious condition during or after the service.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Allergic/Adverse Reactions</span><br>
            You agree that Paw Paw is not responsible for allergic reactions resulting from the manufacturer-recommended
            usage of any products. Although a pet may experience an allergic reaction to grooming products at any time,
            flee and tick products are associated with higher incidence of reactions. Please consult your veterinarian
            prior to having your pet treated if you have any questions concerning your pet’s sensitivity to such
            treatments. IF FRONTLINE PLUS FOR DOGS HAS BEEN APPLIED, AVOID CONTACT WITH TREATED AREA UNTIL DTY. DO NOT
            ALLOW THE PRODUCT TO BE INGESTED. DO NOT USE FRONTLINE PLUS FOR DOG, ON CATS.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Service Policies Abandonment</span><br>
            Your pet will be dried using a kennel dryer or velocity dryer (however, as a policy, we do not use kennel
            dryers on brachycephalic breeds or senior dogs). If you have a specific request for a drying method, it is
            your responsibility to advise us. Your pet will be tethered during the service. If we feel the safety or
            well-being of your pet and /or and associate is at risk, a muzzle may be used, or we may refuse or
            discontinue service. An Express Groom is available for an additional charge if you feel that your dog would
            be benefit for any reason including, but not limited to, pre-existing medical conditions, breed-related
            conformation, or sensitivity to stress, noise and kenneling, and required the pet to be picked up at service
            completion. Any pet not picked up within 24 hours of completion of a service may be, at our sole discretion,
            turned over to humane society or adoption agency.<br>
            <br>
            <span>Customer Information/indemnification</span><br>
            In the event you pet is involved in an incident (e.g. biting a person or another pet) (“Incident”), you
            hereby authorize PawPaw to release your name and contact information to any party involved in the Incident
            and/or the appropriate governmental authority. You agree to defend and indemnify Paw Paw for any claims,
            damages, or costs arising out of or related to any Incident.<br>
            <br>
